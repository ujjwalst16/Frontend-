    <h1>Information about Programming Languages</h1>
    <h2>C Language</h2>
    <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3295258.png" alt=""width="300" height="300">
    <p>C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.

        It is said that ‘C’ is a god’s programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If you know ‘C,’ you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of ‘C’</p>
        <h2>Cpp Language</h2>
        <img src="https://www.go4expert.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cpp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language. This language allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming. It is an expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers. This C++ Tutorial will cover all the basic to advanced topics of C++ like C++ basics, C++ functions, C++ classes, OOPs and STL concepts.</p>
        <h2>Java</h2>

        <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.

            JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based,</p>
        <h2>Python</h2>

        <h2>Java Script</h2>

        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

            JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
        <h2>Jython</h2>
        <img src="https://terminalroot.com/assets/img/jython/jython.jpg" alt=""width="300" height="300">
        <p>It’s not hidden that Java is a powerful and Python is a simple and easy language. To get them both together, Jython was introduced so it is both powerful and simple. It is a pure Java implementation of Python. It uses Python’s syntax and Java’s environment. It allows using features of Python in Java environment or to import Java classes in Python codes and hence, is very flexible. Jython can run on almost any platform which provides flexibility in application deployment and it also provides many libraries with many more APIs. It is really beneficial for those who create applications in Java and are new to Python. Python has three implementations:
            Cpython(mostly used)
            Jython
            IronPython</p>
        <h2>Lotus Script</h2>

        <p>otusScript is an object-oriented programming language used by Lotus Notes (since version 4.0) and other IBM Lotus Software products.

            LotusScript is similar to Visual Basic.[1] Developers familiar with one can easily understand the syntax and structure of code in the other. The major differences between the two are in their respective integrated development environments and in the product-specific object classes provided in each language that are included. VB includes a richer set of classes for UI manipulation, whereas LotusScript includes a richer set of application-specific classes for Lotus Notes, Lotus Word Pro and Lotus 1-2-3. In the case of Lotus Notes, there are classes to work with Notes databases, documents (records) in those databases, etc. These classes can also be used as OLE Automation objects outside the Lotus Notes environment, from Visual Basic.</p>
        <h2>PHP</h2>

        <p>The term PHP is an acronym for – Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The file extension of PHP is “.php”. 

            PHP was introduced by Rasmus Lerdorf in the first version and participated in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. </p>
        <h2>Node JS</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp5070716.jpg" alt=""width="300" height="300">
        <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It’s a powerful tool suitable for a wide range of projects. Node.js stands out as a game-changer. Imagine using the power of JavaScript not only in your browser but also on the server side. </p>

        <h2>Ruby</h2>

        <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

            Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, Java, and Lisp.[10
